The vite project is inside folder A1, so before executing npm, execute cd a1, cd A1.
In this Piazza's post, it says that there is no problem: https://piazza.com/class/lqbd36y5h1a3f3/post/81

Things I did after clarifying something on piazza:

Rotating correctly the stars: https://piazza.com/class/lqbd36y5h1a3f3/post/82
How to add an SKevent: https://piazza.com/class/lqbd36y5h1a3f3/post/88
Implementing timeout for gesture: https://piazza.com/class/lqbd36y5h1a3f3/post/104

In my code, I implemented the bonus mark: Gesture only works if the movement is upwards, doing more or less a straight line.

From other sources, I only used copilot for mundane tasks, as comments, or repeating some code, and for the mathematical equation of the starts, I searched it in the internet, and then implemented in code.
